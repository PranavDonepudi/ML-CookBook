# ML-CookBook
This Repo is used to clear my undersatnding of ML and get to work on projects which focus on basics of ML and yet very informative for learning and Data preprocessing.

# What to Expect here ?
These repos shows how we can leverage on Libraries like scikit-learn and pytorch to train,test,fine tune our Models. They show different metrics to evaluate models and process of preparing the data and analysing it, also model selection and feature engineering.
